# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the failing batch add functionality in the ProductList.vue component. Currently, when users fill out the "批量新增" (Batch Add) form and click "确定" (Confirm), the system fails to create new product records in the MySQL database. This feature will diagnose and fix the batch add functionality to ensure products are successfully created and stored in the database.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to be able to batch add multiple products through the "批量新增" form, so that I can efficiently create multiple product records at once.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I fill out the batch add form with valid product information THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields
2. WHEN I click "确定" (Confirm) after filling the form THEN the system SHALL create the specified number of product records in the MySQL database
3. WHEN the batch creation is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message indicating how many products were created
4. WHEN the batch creation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining what went wrong
5. WHEN products are successfully created THEN the product list SHALL refresh automatically to show the new records

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to see proper validation and confirmation dialogs during batch add, so that I can verify my input before creating products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit the batch add form THEN the system SHALL validate that all required fields are filled
2. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog with a summary of what will be created
3. WHEN I confirm the creation THEN the system SHALL proceed with creating the products
4. IF the total quantity would exceed production batch limits THEN the system SHALL show a warning dialog asking for confirmation
5. WHEN I cancel at any confirmation step THEN the system SHALL return to the form without creating any products

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want the batch add functionality to handle errors gracefully, so that I understand what went wrong and can take corrective action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API request fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display a network error message
2. WHEN the API request fails due to validation errors THEN the system SHALL display the specific validation error messages
3. WHEN the database operation fails THEN the system SHALL display a database error message
4. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to the console for debugging
5. WHEN an error occurs THEN the loading state SHALL be properly cleared and the form SHALL remain accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the batch add API integration to be robust and properly structured, so that it reliably communicates with the backend MySQL database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating products THEN the system SHALL send properly formatted data matching the expected API schema
2. WHEN the API response is received THEN the system SHALL handle both success and error responses appropriately
3. WHEN products are created THEN the system SHALL generate unique product IDs and file paths for QR codes and barcodes
4. WHEN the creation is complete THEN the system SHALL refresh the product list to reflect the new data
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL log all API requests and responses to the console
